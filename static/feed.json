    "comment": "I took this recipe from Tasty Ever After and simplified it a bit. Received many compliments!",
    "ingredients": [
      "3lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs",
      "1 cup barbecue sauce",
      "1 T apple cider vinegar",
      "1/2 medium red onion",
      "4-5 cloves of garlic",
      "1 tsp olive oil"
    ],
    "recipe": "Peel and chop the onion and garlic. Place both in the Instant Pot with your olive oil and turn on the Saute function. Saute the onion and garlic until soft. Add all of the chicken, 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce, and all of the apple cider vinegar. Lock the lid, select the Poultry setting, and set the timer for 20 minutes. When the cycle is done, do a quick release, open the lid, and shred the chicken. There will be a lot of liquid at this point, do not worry. Leave the lid off and turn on the Saute function. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce and mix for a few minutes as the chicken continues to thread. Spoon chicken onto medium sized, toasted buns. Serves 8.",

However, a thought occurred to me today: instead of talking about the work I'm getting out of the code, what if I talked about the joy I'm getting out of it? The Truffle project is something I do in my spare time for no money. I don't believe I'll ever get rich off it, but there's certainly a lot of opportunity for joy. Part of what brings me joy is running the script that generates a \"blank\" truffle I can start filling. I'm making a point to start every session I work on Truffle with that joy!",
